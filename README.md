# simplifed-battle-sim


Description: This is a simplied Pokemon Battle Simulator, made as a school project and for fun and practice. People not familar with pokemon will not notice the simplification. That being said, the simplifications made are listed below.


1. No items or abilites. If you add a new text file to the teamFiles, these must be removed.
2. IVs are automatically assumed to be 31. this must also be removed if you add a new file.
3. the only status moves present in this game, are ones that raise your stats and lower the opponent's stats. 
4. This is only includes pokemon and mechanics up to and including the 5th generation of pokemon.

 Teams are taken randomly from text files. There are only 5 currently, but more could be added easily. 

 Instructions: Run the Driver.java file. Seeing as a lot of pokemon revolves around information, there's no good way to do this on one computer. Instead, we have a bad way, which is essentially that there are 3 seconds between turns for someone to pass the computer around.
