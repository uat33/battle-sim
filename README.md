# simplifed-battle-sim


Description: A simplified Pokemon Battle Simulator, meant for two people to play against each other. People not familar with pokemon will not notice the simplification. That being said, the simplifications made are listed below.


1. No items or abilities.
2. IVs are automatically assumed to be 31.
3. The only status moves present in this game are ones that raise your stats and lower the opponent's stats.
4. This only includes pokemon and mechanics up to and including the 5th generation of pokemon.

 Teams are taken randomly from text files.

 Instructions: Run the main.Main.java file. Seeing as a lot of pokemon revolves around information, there's no good way to do this on one computer. Instead, there are 3 seconds between turns using Thread.sleep for players to pass the computer around.
