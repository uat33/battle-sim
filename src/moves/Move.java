    // you could change it to 0 when adding it to the array list
    // however the damage is literally nothing, so that value is never used, so there isn't actually any point in doing the conversion

    // accuracy can't be saved as an int either because certain moves cannot miss no matter what.
    // these moves are different from moves with a 100 accuracy because those can miss due to stat changes or special effects
    // those unmissable moves are also saved as -
    // and once again we can't convert it
